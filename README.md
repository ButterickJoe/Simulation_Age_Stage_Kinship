Matrix model folder = code to implement theoretical matrix projections approach to kinship

Simulation functions = code to implement stochastic simulation of kinship network

Outputs = results of the matrix based approach and simaultion approach, with plots to comapre the two

Both time variant and time invariant cases are considered, as directed by subfolders
